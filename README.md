# Nutrition Plan Generator with AI 🍽️🥗

This is a React-based web application that allows users to generate personalized nutrition plans using AI. The application takes user inputs such as name, age, weight, height, activity level, and dietary preferences and sends these to a backend API to generate a tailored nutrition plan. The generated plan is displayed with a typewriter effect for an engaging user experience.
